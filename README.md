string login = "user@gmail.com";
string passwd = "my-password";

GoogleMusicWebClient WebClient = new GoogleMusicWebClient();

Console.WriteLine("Login...\n");
WebClient.Login(login, passwd);

Console.WriteLine("Reading library...\n");
Tracklist tracks = WebClient.GetAllTracks();

tracks.SortByAlbumArtist();

foreach (Track track in tracks)
    Console.WriteLine("{0} - {1}", track.albumArtistUnified, track.title);

Console.WriteLine("Reading playlists...\n");
Playlists playlists = WebClient.GetPlaylists();

foreach (Playlist playlist in playlists)
    Console.WriteLine(playlist.ToString());
    
```
